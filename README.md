# EXPERIMENT 1 - Intro to Python

### Introduction 
This notebook covers sample Python problems with code implementations for various tasks, such as sorting strings, 
and manipulating user inputs. Some examples are taken from the internet for reference purposes.

## Objectives
- Understand basic Python functions through sample code problems
- Practice sorting strings, handling user inputs, and manipulating lists
- Learn how to work with user-defined functions
- Apply Pythonâ€™s list unpacking and string replacement techniques


### Problem 1: Sorting Letters
- A function is created to sort the letters of a string alphabetically.
- An example word ("PYTHON") is sorted to produce "HNOPTY".

### Problem 2: Sentence Word Replacement
- A menu-driven script allows users to replace words like "smile," "sad," and "mad" in a sentence with corresponding emoticons.
    
### Problem 3: List Unpacking
- Demonstrates how to unpack lists and extract the first, middle, and last items using Python's unpacking syntax.

### How to Use
- Run each cell in order inside a Jupyter Notebook.
- Provide inputs as prompted (e.g., word, age, or sentence).
- View the outputs directly below each code cell.

### Software Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy library

### Troubleshooting
- Input Errors: Make sure to input values in the expected format (e.g., a word, a number for age).
